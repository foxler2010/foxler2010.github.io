# Information about my website

This is the third time I've made a README for this place, and I hope that this one explains it the best of all:

I want to make stuff and the web is the best place to do it.

I am not very experienced with making stuff on the web.

I am using this space to learn, experiment, and create (hopefully) interesting things.

You can see the result on drewssite.top!

# Todo list
## Timeline
I am thinking of making a sort of timeline of the history of my development journey,
although it wold take a bit and I'd rather save it for when the base pieces of this website are complete.

It will probably be accessible from the about page in the future.
