My name is Drew, and I'm an overall pretty normal person. Except I don't think of it that way. I'm totally not normal. The most un-normal person around. It's up to you whether that's true or false. You get the idea.

I like computers, and know the basics of how to code Java. I also know HTML, and could understand CSS but not write it. For some reason I never learned JavaScript but it's an easy enough language so I would probably understand it if you gave it to me. My biggest talents, though, have to be in the terminal. I know a lot about Linux and have dipped my finger in many a distribution, even tried making my own once (I failed).

I have four Raspberry Pis, a really cool server (used for a variety of things), and a PC that I use to do intensive computing (aka games).

I don't know Photoshop, but was able to use it that one time when I needed it for erasing the background of my logo. (You can see the result at the top of the page now!)

I do know how to belay a rock climber, and would gladly do that for a living instead of all the other things I just mentioned.

That's about all you need to know about me. If you want more, read the blog. (Unfortunately there are not a lot of posts and I haven't made any in like 2 years so that's fun...)

Now go do something else this is the end of the page.
