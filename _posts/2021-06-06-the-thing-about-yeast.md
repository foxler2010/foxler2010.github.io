You know how bread is made, right? You pile on the ingredients: flour, corn meal, sugar, etc. You let the dough rise. You put it in a breadpan, and you cook it in the oven. You'd think that is all, but there is much more to it that I would like to inquire about. Specifically about yeast. The special ingredient that *does* stuff.<!--more--> There is a lot behind the scenes that goes into making bread, along with a lot of other products that require the ingredient (or some sort of equivalent). Today I am going on a deep dive in to what makes yeast, *yeast*!

## Before we get started

I'm no scientist, but I do know what yeast is and what it does. Oh, and with that, *please* take everything you see here with a grain of salt. I don't actually know the chemical reactions going on inside your bread while it's cooking or rising. I'm only imagining what the future could look like in a few certain scenarios. And since this is my first blog post, I'd like it if you somehow stay tuned in to this site. I'm very passionate about what I do, and I do it for free. So, if you like content like this, I think it is in your best interest to listen in. Now, let's begin...

## Background Information

Most people know that yeast is a living thing. It may look like a fine powder, but it is a sort of bacteria (or other small organism) that eats ingredients like flour, and emits a waste product (which I do not know the name of).

When you add yeast to your bread dough, it wakes up from the sleep state it is in when you got it and it starts to eat the stuff in the dough and output waste. And the waste is what makes the dough rise.

Inside the yeast (like all other organisms), a chemical reaction occurs in the mitochondria of the cell. The mitochondria takes in the food, and converts it to energy (really just another molecule that contains chemical energy which the organism uses to sustain its life processes). Most of the time, there is also some stuff in the food that the organism does not need, ie. waste, which the organism expels. Also, when the mitochondria does its chem reaction stuff, there can be a byproduct of the reaction which is unneeded. In humans, this byproduct is water, and it is part of the liquid in our bladder. And, also in humans, the food we eat has waste we don't process into energy at all; this waste goes out our rectum (trying to sound sciency right now btw, sorry for anyone unpleased with my usage of these words). In yeast, it is probably a similar story, and the waste expelled makes the dough of our bread rise.

## The good stuff

Now that we understand the basis for all life, we can begin to understand the practical and industrial uses of yeast as we know it today. Today, yeast can be found in packets in many grocery stores and is a common ingredient used when making things that require leavening or fermentation. It is used in an industrial setting for the exact same purpose, only on a bigger scale. And now to see some images of yeast in use at a factory.





### Time to go watch How It's Made.





Okay, welcome back. Hope you enjoyed watching that episode of How It's Made. I certainly did. Let's recap. Yeast was poured into the mix of ingredients and they let it sit in a sealed container of stuff where fermentation happened. And then they got wine. The yeast lived in there for a few months/years and fed on the stuff in there (grapes, in the case of wine). It released waste after eating the grapes, and when all was done, we had a tasty drink for 21 and up.

## The problem and the solution

Now, as you know, the waste is produced by either not interacting with part of the food, or interacting with it and producing the cool energy chemical that fuels cells, while also producing a by-product which is ejected from the cell.

Now, there are a lot of drawbacks to having bacteria eat your food and you eat their waste. Number 1, and the most important in this case, is that it's slow. You are a lot bigger than a bacterium, so even an entire bacterium's life of eating and pooing in your chemical soup is not enough to even produce one bottle of wine for you to drink.

But what if we could eliminate the yeast? Use some other method to ferment the grapes, or let the bread rise? This is where I propose a new way to manufacture foods that require yeast. We use a machine to simnulate the yeast. This machine kicks off the chemical reaction that ages wine and leavens bread, it is the like the intestines of the yeast, digesting the grapes and flour and outputting risen dough and aged wine. And since it is a machine, it will do it so much faster than the living organism. That's my idea, so I guess that's it.

## In the end...

Okay, so I did fail biology in 5th grade, so maybe I am not as smart as I think, but I did pass honors biology freshman year, so that's okay I guess. Then, why was I taking biology in 5th grade in the first place? Why am I writing this post about yeast when I could be doing other, more productive things? Why do I exist, anyway? I guess I just got carried away, or whatever. See you once I do something not stupid like start thinking about yeast and life as we know it...
