this was an interesting (albeit weird) post about yeast, but i have removed it for the time being since it just sort of looks funny being the only post on the homepage. Speaking of that, I am hopefully getting some help fixing the homepage problem and will make a post describing that after it is fixed. Then I will make a third post about something else to give this post some company, and after that restore this post as it will fit in more when the page is complete.
