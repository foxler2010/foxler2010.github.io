So, I haven't been doing a lot of work lately on any of my projects. (That excludes all the gaming I've been doing...) I hope to make some major progress soon but I'm still working up the courage to post an issue in a repository I haven't contributed to in any way. Yes, I am using the software, but I don't normally take to GitHub to solve all my problems. That's reserved for Stack Overflow, which I still don't feel especially happy when posting a question on. I think it has something to do with you admitting to a bunch of internet strangers that you made a mistake, or that someone else did something wrong that is messing up your version of the software. Either way I don't like it. But I have to do it anyway because I've exhausted all my options. I can't leave this website broken forever. It has to live up to its standards, and I can't let it do that unless I have outside help. So that's that.

On a side note, as I'm typing this, Eclipse believes that the words "website" and "internet" do not exit and are spelled wrong. I mean come on, this is software DOWNLOADED from the internet, it should at least know that "internet" and "website" are in fact, words. I have to wonder who made Eclipse's spell-checking dictionary, and especially when it was made, because this is the latest version of the software. Someone's got to have noticed things like these by now...

That's pretty much it for this post. I'm not doing anything, and I'm waiting on help to arrive to fix my website. And, even though it is broken, do please come back later when it isn't. I like visitors and and want to share the stuff I do with them.

either way bye.
